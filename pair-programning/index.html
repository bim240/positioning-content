            <div class="box red">
                <p>
                    These two divs are positioned next to onc another using <span class="bg1">display: inline—block</span>
                </p>

                     Notice the space between them. It occurs because Of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would bc between two inline elements.
                </p>

        <div class="clearfix">
            <div class="box green float-lt">
                <p>
                    These two are positioned using <span class="bg1">float: left</span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box green float-lt">
                <p>
                    You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. •mis may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box big-box red">
                <p>
                    What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box big-box red">
                <p>
                        Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.
                </p>

        <div class="block clearfix">
            <div class="box float-lt green big-box">
                <p>
                    If I do the same thing with floated elements...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box float-lt green big-box">
                <p>
                    The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the sanw as the width of the viewport.
